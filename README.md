# Neural-Network-MNIST
Neural Network made with only the numpy library. Pandas and matplotlib.pyplot used for data visualization.
This project is about understanding the steps neural networks take during training. A different data source of the MNIST dataset was used compared to the original project to be able to evaluate the change in accuracy when more points of data are used in training and testing.

Tools:
<ul>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Matplotlib.Pyplot</li>
</ul>
